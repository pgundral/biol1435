    "For today's exercise we'll be building a small classifier that can infer the ancestries of query haplotypes after being trained on many haplotype - ancestry pairs. Put another way, this model will learn to classify haplotypes as belonging to different populations. We will only be using simulated data for this exercise, so let's start by defining some functions to simulate our data. We will begin with a simple 3 population model with no migration:"
